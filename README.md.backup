# L4D2: Rage Edition 🔥

Transform Left 4 Dead 2 into an action-packed co-op experience! Pick your class, unleash devastating abilities, and survive the chaos with friends. Think of it as your favorite zombie shooter... but turned up to 11.

## What Makes It Special? ✨

**Choose Your Hero** – Six unique classes (Soldier, Ninja, Trooper, Medic, Engineer, Saboteur) each with their own superpowers and playstyle

**Epic Abilities** – Deploy turrets, throw experimental grenades, go invisible, heal teammates, call in airstrikes, and way more

**Survival Tools** – Self-revive when downed, crawl while incapacitated, struggle free from infected pins, and help your teammates even when you're down

**Slick Controls** – Hold ALT for a radial menu that lets you change classes, toggle settings, and trigger abilities—all with WASD navigation

**Custom Everything** – Play your own music, customize every ability, adjust difficulty, and tinker with 100+ settings

**Built for Fun** – Less grind, more action. Every round feels like a blockbuster movie scene

## Getting Started (Super Easy!)

**For Players:**
1. Join a server running Rage Edition
2. Press ALT to open the quick menu
3. Pick your class and learn your abilities from the menu
4. Type `!guide` in chat to open the full tutorial anytime

**For Server Owners:**
1. Drop the `sourcemod/` folder into your L4D2 server directory
2. Edit `configs/rage_class_skills.cfg` to customize classes and abilities
3. (Optional) Tweak settings in `cfg/sourcemod/talents.cfg` for cooldowns and limits
4. Restart your server and you're good to go!

**Pro tip:** Use Docker Compose if you want a one-click setup—just run `docker-compose up` and everything works out of the box.

## How to Use Your Abilities

Every class has special powers! Here's how to trigger them:

| What it does | Default controls | Quick tip |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------- |
| **Main ability** | Middle mouse button | Your class's signature move |
| **Second ability** | Use + Fire together | Combo power |
| **Third ability** | Crouch + Use + Fire | Extra trick up your sleeve |
| **Deploy stuff** | Look down + Hold Shift | Drop turrets, supplies, or mines |

**Too complicated?** Just press ALT and select abilities from the quick menu instead!

You can also rebind these in `configs/rage_skill_actions.cfg` or use console commands like `skill_action_1`, `skill_action_2`, etc.

## Predicaments Plugin

Configure via `cfg/sourcemod/l4d2_predicaments.cfg` (auto-generated on first load). Key convars:
- `l4d2_predicament_enable` - Master switch (default: 1)
- `l4d2_predicament_use` - Items allowed: 0=none, 1=pills/adrenaline, 2=medkits, 3=both (default: 3)
- `self_help_crawl_enable` - Enable incapped crawling (default: 1)

For developers: The plugin provides API hooks via `l4d2_predicaments.inc` for controlling healing and struggle mechanics.

## Toys, tricks, and server spice
- **Music player** – Type `!music` to choose the soundtrack, skip songs, or go silent. Preferences stick with you between maps.
- **Away toggle** – Need a breather? Mark yourself AFK directly from the menu and hop back in when ready.
- **Multiple equipment mode** – Pick how forgiving pickups are, from classic single-use kits to double-tap weapon swaps.
- **Voting hub** – Launch game mode and map votes without fumbling chat commands.
- **Custom gamemodes** - Escort mission, Jockey chase, deathmatch 1v1 modes. By choosing gamemode, available maps are updated.
- **Command parity** – Every feature also has an `sm_` console command so you can bind keys or build macros exactly how you like.

## Soundtrack corner
Drop a list of 44.1 kHz audio files (WAV/MP4 are safest) into the supplied music text files, point your fast-download host at them, and the plugin does the rest. First-time players can even hear a special welcome track if you enable the option.

### Music directory
Custom tracks belong in the repo-level `music/` folder. Docker Compose mounts that directory into the server at `left4dead2/sound/custom/rage` so the entries in `sourcemod/data/music_mapstart*.txt` resolve correctly (e.g., `custom/rage/my_track.wav`).

Want music out of the box? Run `python music/download_soundtrack.py --out music` to fetch MP4s for the DOOM/DOOM II gamerip directly from downloads.khinsider.com. The pull includes Zorasoft's licenseless **Project Doom** album (https://zorasoft.net/prjdoom.html) so you still get Intro Stomp, Midnight Assault, and Final Push without storing the WAVs in the repository.

## Admin corner
Need to tidy the battlefield? `!rageadm` opens a dedicated panel with spawn helpers, restart controls, god mode, and slow-motion toggles. Everything is grouped for quick decisions mid-round.

## Ready to tinker?
Rage Edition is built from modular SourceMod plugins, so you can add new talents, swap out effects, or write your own class packs without touching the core. Check the `sourcemod/scripting` folder for clean, well-documented examples.

Grab the files, drop them on your server, tweak `configs/rage_class_skills.cfg` to taste, and let the rage weekend begin.
