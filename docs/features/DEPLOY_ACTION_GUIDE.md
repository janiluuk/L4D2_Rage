# Deploy Action Guide

## What is the Deploy Action?

The **Deploy Action** is a special ability available to all classes that allows players to place items, open supply menus, or deploy equipment on the battlefield. Each class has a different deploy action:

### Class-Specific Deploy Actions:

1. **Soldier** - Opens Engineer Supply Menu (ammo packs, etc.)
2. **Athlete** - Opens Medic Supply Menu (health packs, etc.)
3. **Medic** - Opens Medic Supply Menu (health packs, pain pills, etc.)
4. **Saboteur** - Opens Saboteur Mines Menu (motion-sensitive mines)
5. **Commando** - Opens Engineer Supply Menu (ammo packs, etc.)
6. **Engineer** - Opens Turret Selection Menu (portable turrets)
7. **Brawler** - Opens Medic Supply Menu (health packs, etc.)

## How to Activate the Deploy Action

### Activation Method:
1. **Hold Left CTRL** (Crouch key) - The deployment menu will appear immediately
2. **Release Left CTRL** - The menu will close automatically

### Requirements:
- You must be **on solid ground** (not in the air or on a ladder)
- You cannot deploy in **saferooms** (start or end safe areas)
- Some deploy actions have **cooldowns** or **usage limits** per round

### Visual Feedback:
- When you hold CTRL, the appropriate menu for your class will appear
- When you release CTRL, the menu closes automatically
- If you try to deploy in an invalid location, you'll see a hint message explaining why
